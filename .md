# System Design Document v1

## 1. High-Level Architecturial Options

## Option 1: Microservices
- Independent Services communicating via APIs
- Highly scalable and maintainable
- Each services can be deployed independently

### Option 2: Monolith
- Single codebase containing all features
- Easier to deploy initially
- Harder to scale as system grows
- Changes in one part can affect the whole system

---

## 2. Main Branch Decision
- After team discussion, the architecture choice is **Microservices**
- This allows for scalability and parallel development
- System will be divided into modules:
- User Service
- Event/Ticket service
- Payment service
- Notification Service

---

## 3. Client Change Request
- Client emailed a change request: prefers **Microservices architecture**
- Updates required to reflect client preference:
- Focus on designing independent services
- Ensure APIs are well-documented for intergration
- This change is applied in a separate branch called 'client-change'

---

## 4. Merge Conflict Notes
- When merging 'Client-change' into 'main', a conflict occured because both branches  updated the architecture section
- Conflict resolved by keeping:
- Team's Microservices decision
- Client preference note
- Final merged version reflects both decisions
